\section*{Task 2 - The Bridge Problem}
The fastest way to solve the bridge problem is by 
having the knight and lady go (2 minutes) then the knight back
(2+1=3 minutes) followed by the king and queen (3+10=13mins). 
After this the lady goes back (13+2=15mins) and the knight
and lady cross over to finish (15+2=17mins).
\section*{Task 3 - Explaining PAT}
The first section (lines 4-9) defines the constants using 
$\#define var \leq value \geq$. Max is the most amount of time allowed
KNIGHT is the amount of time it takes for the knight to cross, and so on for
the people. Following this we define vars (lines 11-15) with 
$var varName = \leq value \geq$. These are variables
that can be changed, and these symbolise the side that the
people are on for each person. \\
\tab Next we need to define the processes in lines 17-37 
(usually called models) which has the syntax of 
$processName() = [condition]actionName{action} -> nextProcess [] ...$
. To explain, processName is the name of the process (in our case
South()), and condition is a conditional statement to be allowed
to do the action. Next the actionName is what it prints as 
the action for record and action is what it actually does. Next
we define which process to go to after doing this in nextProcess
and the square brackets essentially functions as a comma between
actions. \\
\tab In line 41 we do $\#define goal(conditional);$ which 
defines the conditional
for when a node is considered succesful which we use in 
$\#assert processName() reaches goal$ on lines 44-46. Essentially, 
this means that the model has a state where a node in the 
search has a state that satisfies the goal. To expand
on this we can pick which node to print using 
$with selection(var)$ in line 46 which picks which node to 
print - in our case we want the minimum.\\
For our output with the minimum time, it looks like this:
