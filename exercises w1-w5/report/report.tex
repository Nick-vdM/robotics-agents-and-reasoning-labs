\section*{Question 3}
\textbf{\textit{
    \tab What is DOF? If a robot can only move forward and backward, how many DOFs does it have? In most cases, how many DOFs does a robot leg has?

\section*{Question 6}
\textbf{\textit{

}} \\ \\
\section*{Question 7}
\textbf{\textit{
    \tab Describe the Hybrid paradigm in terms of: (a) sensing, acting, and planning, and (b) sensing organization.
}} \\ \\
\section*{Question 8}
\textbf{\textit{
    \tab Look up technical reports on Shakey. Compare Shakey with the Hybrid architectures.  Now  consider  the  possible  impact  of the  radical  increases  in processing power since the 1960â€™s. Do you agree or disagree with the statement that Shakey would be as capable as any Hybrid if it were built today? Justify your answer.
